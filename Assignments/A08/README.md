## A08 - Copy Constructor
### Caleb Sneath
### Description:

This folder displays the use of copy constructors, dynamic memory allocation for objects, as well as overloading operators. The program is a modification of an earlier program which added an RgbColor class to store color info.

Modifications to the original program include finishing unfinished original RgbColor class methods, the inclusion of a class that can store colors, some operator overloads, as well as some basic code to display the above code works as intended.
